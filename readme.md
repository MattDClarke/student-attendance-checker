# Student Attendance Checker

A simple program to check attendance for multiple classes from a saved in-meeting Zoom chat. The class names and student numbers are saved in an object in studentNumbers.js. A user pastes a saved in-meeting Zoom chat in the text area. The regex used checks for student numbers, which are 9 digits long in this case. There is also a check for incorrectly typed student numbers.
